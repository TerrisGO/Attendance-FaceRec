# Attendance-FaceRec
Automating attendance using Face Recognition via Neural Networks 

The entire process of marking attendance in educational institutions, workplaces, when automized is the best and most cost effective way of making it fool-proof and better.

This makes proxy attendance impossible and the workplace ethics- trustworthy

This, while isn't the perfect way, it's an attempt to do something similar

This is an implementation by me using various methods - Via Multi Threaded Cascaded Neural Networks

---To Run the Program----

1) Clone the project
2) Change the directort/file locations in Recog, Dupli and Readonly--- It's set to work with my system. IF not changed, there'll be an error: "File not found"
3) Run Add New.py to add new persons to the dataset
4) Open Recog.py and add your name to  names = {} (line 28) to make your name is in program's attendance register
5) Run Recog.py to mark attendance and finalize
6) Output is obtained as Attendance.xlsx- a read only to make sure editing is not done
